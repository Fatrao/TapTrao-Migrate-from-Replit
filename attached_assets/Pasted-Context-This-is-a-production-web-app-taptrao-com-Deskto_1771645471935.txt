Context
This is a production web app (taptrao.com).
Desktop layout is acceptable. Mobile layout is broken and must be fixed without redesigning the product.

Target devices: iPhone 12–15, Android Chrome (360–430px width).

🎯 Objective

Fix mobile responsiveness and readability on the homepage without changing branding, copy, or product logic.

🧱 Problems to fix (observed on mobile)

Navigation bar

Logo + text overlap or feel cramped

Menu items (“Compliance Lookup”, “LC Checker”, “Pricing”) are too close

No clear mobile hierarchy

Hero section

Headline (“Know your compliance before you commit.”) is too large vertically

Excessive vertical spacing pushes CTA too far down

Subtitle text is low contrast and hard to read on mobile

Buttons

Primary CTA (“Run your first lookup”) is good but spacing above/below is inconsistent

Secondary CTA (“See pricing”) is visually weak and misaligned

Overall

Too much unused vertical space

Text blocks not optimised for one-hand mobile reading

Mobile view feels like desktop shrunk, not mobile-first

🛠 Required fixes (DO THESE, NOTHING EXTRA)
1. Mobile Navigation

Convert top navigation into:

Left: TapTrao logo (icon + wordmark stacked or inline)

Right: hamburger menu

Hamburger opens a full-height mobile drawer with:

Compliance Lookup

LC Checker

Pricing

Increase tap targets (min 44px height)

2. Hero Section (Mobile)

Reduce headline font size to max 36px

Set line height for headline to 1.15–1.2

Reduce top padding so headline appears immediately on load

Increase subtitle contrast (lighter grey or white)

Limit subtitle width to avoid edge-to-edge text

3. Buttons

Primary CTA:

Full-width button on mobile

Fixed height (48–52px)

Secondary CTA:

Text button or outlined button

Centered

Clear spacing below primary CTA

4. Spacing & Layout

Use a single-column layout

Reduce vertical margins by ~30%

Apply consistent padding: 16px or 20px max

No new components, no animations

🎨 Design constraints (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT change colours

Do NOT change fonts

Do NOT change copy

Do NOT add new sections

Only adjust:

CSS

Tailwind classes

Media queries

Flex/grid behavior

✅ Definition of done

Page fits fully on mobile without horizontal scrolling

CTA visible above the fold

Navigation usable with one thumb

No visual clutter

Desktop layout unchanged

🧪 Testing

Test at widths: 360px, 390px, 414px

Test dark mode if enabled
