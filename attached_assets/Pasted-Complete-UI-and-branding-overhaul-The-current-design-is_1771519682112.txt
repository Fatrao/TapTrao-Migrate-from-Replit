Complete UI and branding overhaul. The current design is unacceptable. 
Rebuild everything from scratch.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Wise.com level of cleanliness and trustworthiness for the app UI
- Full-bleed African landscape photography as hero backgrounds 
  (like the Paloseco reference — photography does the emotional work, 
  UI stays minimal on top)
- Generous white space everywhere — nothing cramped, nothing competing
- The app itself (lookup, dashboard, LC checker) stays clean and 
  functional — photography only on landing page and section breaks
- Never overwhelming. If in doubt, remove something.

COLOUR PALETTE — extracted from African landscapes:
- Deep forest green: #1A3D2B (Congo rainforest)
- Warm ochre: #C4882B (savannah grass, Ghana rock)
- Terracotta: #B5521A (West African laterite soil)
- Misty grey: #8C9BA5 (harmattan sky, coastal haze)
- Turquoise: #2AADA8 (East African coast, Zanzibar)
- Warm white: #FAF8F4 (background — never pure white)
- Cream: #F2EDE4 (card surfaces)
- Dark text: #1C1C1A
- Secondary text: #6B6457
- Border: #E2D9CC

PRIMARY ACTIONS: ochre #C4882B (buttons, CTAs, active states)
SECONDARY ACTIONS: forest green #1A3D2B
ALERTS/WARNING: terracotta #B5521A
SUCCESS: #1A6B3A

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: Plus Jakarta Sans, 700/800 weight
- Body: Inter, 400/500
- Numbers/refs: JetBrains Mono
Import both from Google Fonts.

LANDING PAGE — complete rebuild:

NAVIGATION:
- Sticky, transparent over hero image, white background after scroll
- Left: "TapTrao" wordmark in Plus Jakarta Sans, weight 800, 
  colour #1C1C1A
- Right: "Compliance Lookup" · "LC Checker" · "Pricing" · 
  "Start free" button (ochre, small, rounded)
- Clean, no clutter. Maximum 4 nav items.

HERO SECTION:
- Full viewport height
- Background: full-bleed image of African coastline or landscape. 
  Use an Unsplash URL for a stunning African landscape image:
  https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489392191049-fc10c97e64b6
  (Ghana coastline with fishing boats — warm, hazy, atmospheric)
  Add a dark overlay: linear-gradient from rgba(26,61,43,0.75) 
  to rgba(26,61,43,0.45) so text is readable
- Headline (white, large, Plus Jakarta Sans 800):
  "Trade compliance for every commodity corridor out of Africa."
- Subheadline (white, 60% opacity, Inter 400, max-width 560px):
  "Duty rates, import requirements, document checklists, and LC 
  validation. Built for European importers buying direct from 
  African producers."
- Two buttons:
  Primary: "Run a free lookup" — ochre background, white text, 
  rounded, generous padding
  Secondary: "See how it works" — white border, white text, 
  transparent background
- Scroll indicator: subtle animated arrow at bottom of hero

TRUST STRIP (immediately below hero, warm cream background):
Single row, centered, spaced:
"18 African origins  ·  154 commodities  ·  UK · EU · Turkey · 
UAE · China · US import rules  ·  UCP 600 validated"
Small caps, secondary text colour, no icons needed.

PROBLEM SECTION (warm white background):
- Large section number "01" in ochre, very light, behind the heading
- Heading: "The paperwork between Africa and Europe is a minefield."
- Subheading: "Most compliance tools were built for 
  manufactured goods from Asia. African commodity corridors are 
  an afterthought — if they're covered at all."
- Three cards in a row (cream background, subtle shadow, 
  12px border-radius, generous padding):
  
  Card 1 — icon: document with X
  Title: "One wrong field. Bank rejected."
  Body: "A single mismatch between your Letter of Credit and 
  your supplier's commercial invoice means the bank refuses 
  to release payment. Demurrage starts immediately."
  
  Card 2 — icon: calendar/alert  
  Title: "Regulations you didn't know existed."
  Body: "EUDR. AfCFTA rules of origin. ECOWAS ETLS. 
  Phytosanitary requirements that change without announcement. 
  You need to know before you commit, not after you've shipped."
  
  Card 3 — icon: person/question
  Title: "Your broker is guessing too."
  Body: "Most freight forwarders and customs brokers handle 
  containerised goods from established corridors. Specialist 
  knowledge on African commodities costs extra — and is often wrong."

HOW IT WORKS SECTION (forest green background, white text):
- Heading (white): "Three inputs. Complete picture."
- Three steps as large numbered cards side by side:
  
  Step 01: "Select your trade"
  "Choose your commodity, origin country, and destination. 
  That's all we need."
  
  Step 02: "Get the full compliance picture"  
  "Duty rates, required documents, regulatory triggers, 
  risk flags, and a ready-to-send supplier brief. One report."
  
  Step 03: "Trade with confidence"
  "Check your LC documents before submitting to the bank. 
  Save successful trades as templates. Get alerted when 
  rules change."

COMMODITIES SECTION (warm white background):
- Heading: "Every commodity. Every corridor."
- Subheading: "Agricultural, mineral, forestry, seafood, 
  and livestock. From raw cashew in Côte d'Ivoire to cobalt 
  ore in the DRC."
- Horizontal scrolling ticker (infinite loop, slow, automatic):
  Show these commodity names in alternating ochre and green:
  Raw Cashew Nuts · Cocoa Beans · Coffee · Sesame Seeds · 
  Gold · Rough Diamonds · Copper Ore · Timber · Tuna · 
  Cotton · Palm Oil · Cobalt · Shea Butter · Iron Ore · 
  Rubber · Tea · Groundnuts · Coltan · Vanilla · Mangoes

PRICING SECTION (cream background):
- Heading: "Pay per check. No subscription trap."
- Subheading: "Buy tokens when you need them. 
  Use them for lookups and document checks."

Two clean pricing cards side by side:
Card 1 (white, ochre top border, 4px):
  "Compliance Lookup"
  "$4.99 per lookup"
  List: ✓ Full regulatory checklist  ✓ Duty estimate  
  ✓ Risk flags  ✓ Supplier brief email  ✓ AfCFTA RoO check
  Button: "Start with a free lookup"

Card 2 (white, green top border, 4px):
  "LC Document Check"  
  "$2.99 per check"
  List: ✓ Up to 6 supplier documents  ✓ UCP 600 validation

  Button: "Check your first LC"

Below cards:

In small secondary text.

FINAL CTA SECTION (another African landscape image as background):
Use: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516026672322-bc52d61a55d5
(Savannah landscape — golden grass, acacia trees, big sky)
Dark overlay same as hero.
White text:
Heading: "Know before you commit."
Subheading: "Run your first compliance lookup free.
