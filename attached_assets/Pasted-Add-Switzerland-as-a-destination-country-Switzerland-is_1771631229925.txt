Add Switzerland as a destination country. Switzerland is NOT in the EU —
it has its own customs territory, tariff schedule, and regulatory framework.
Do NOT copy EU data. Use Swiss-specific values throughout.

━━━ SWISS-SPECIFIC DOCUMENT RULES ━━━

Switzerland requires different documents from the EU in several areas.
Add these rules to the cascade logic (Layer 3 — Destination) when dest_iso2 = 'CH':

BUYER SIDE documents for CH destination:
  All commodity types: Swiss customs declaration (e-dec) — replaces CHIEF/CDS
  Agricultural/food: Import notification to FSVO/BLV — replaces IPAFFS/TRACES
  Plant products: Phytosanitary certificate processed by FPPS/OFAG — NOT via TRACES
  CITES-listed species: Swiss CITES permit (FOEN/BAFU) — parallel to EU CITES
  Timber: Swiss Due Diligence Act compliance statement (for timber/minerals) — parallel to EUDR

SUPPLIER SIDE: same as other destinations — CoO, phyto, invoice, B/L, packing list.
CoO note for CH: EUR.1 movement certificate accepted for preferential tariff under bilateral agreements.

Add to the expandable document detail for CH destination:
  Swiss customs declaration:
    "What: Swiss import declaration filed via e-dec (electronic declaration system).
     Who: Your Swiss customs agent or freight forwarder.
     When: Before goods arrive at Swiss border.
     Tip: Unlike CHIEF/CDS, e-dec submissions are handled by Swiss-licensed brokers only.
          Ensure your freight forwarder has Swiss customs clearance authorisation."

  FSVO import notification:
    "What: Import notification to the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office.
     Who: The importer (you or your Swiss agent).
     When: Minimum 24 hours before arrival for food products.
     Portal: Register at blv.admin.ch. Process similar to IPAFFS but separate system."

━━━ TARIFF NOTE IN RESULTS ━━━

For CH destination, the duty estimate section should show a special note:
  "Swiss agricultural tariffs are often specific (CHF/kg) not ad valorem.
   TARES API provides exact rates — estimate may be indicative for food commodities.
   Verify at tares.admin.ch before quoting landed cost."

Use amber-tinted callout (abg/abd) for this note.

━━━ EUDR EQUIVALENT FOR CH ━━━

When commodity triggers_eudr = true AND dest_iso2 = 'CH':
  Show the EUDR alert block (from Prompt 20) but with modified text:
  "Switzerland has passed its own Due Diligence Act covering timber and minerals.
   Cocoa, coffee, and other EUDR commodities are expected to be added.
   Monitor FOEN/BAFU (bafu.admin.ch) for confirmation of scope and timeline.
   Prepare EUDR-equivalent documentation now — requirements will likely mirror the EU."
  Risk level: amber (pending confirmation, not yet legally required for all commodities)

━━━ VERIFY DESTINATION IS IN DROPDOWNS ━━━

In the compliance lookup form (/lookup), the destination dropdown reads from
the destinations table. Switzerland should now appear in the list.

After inserting, verify:
SELECT country_name, iso2, vat_rate, tariff_source
FROM destinations WHERE iso2 = 'CH';

Expected: Switzerland | CH | 8.1 | Swiss Federal Customs Administration — TARES

Also run a test lookup in the application:
  Commodity: Raw Cashew Nuts (CI)
  Origin: Côte d'Ivoire
  Destination: Switzerland

Expected output:
  - Duty estimate shows TARES as source + amber note about specific tariffs
  - SPS regime shows FSVO/BLV (not IPAFFS, not TRACES)
  - Buyer docs show Swiss e-dec (not CHIEF/CDS)
  - No EUDR alert (cashew does not trigger EUDR)
  - AfCFTA section: does NOT show (CH is not AfCFTA member)

━━━ SELF-CHECK ━━━
Run: SELECT iso2, vat_rate FROM destinations ORDER BY country_name;
Expected: 7 rows (GB, EU, TR, AE, CN, US, CH). VAT for CH = 8.1.
Run: curl -s http://localhost:3000/lookup | grep -o 'Switzerland'
Expected: "Switzerland" (appears in destination dropdown).
