Please implement the following cookie and legal page setup for TapTrao:

─────────────────────────────────────────
1. COOKIE IMPLEMENTATION
─────────────────────────────────────────

Essential cookies (load by default, no consent required):
- Session cookie to keep users logged in
- CSRF security token
- Stripe payment session cookie

Analytics cookies (load ONLY after user clicks Accept):
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4) — inject the following script only after consent is given:

<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>

NOTE: Replace G-XXXXXXXXXX with the real GA4 Measurement ID when available. For now, leave as placeholder — do not load this script at all until consent is given AND the ID is configured.

─────────────────────────────────────────
2. COOKIE CONSENT BANNER
─────────────────────────────────────────

On first visit, display a banner at the bottom of the screen with:
- Text: "We use essential cookies to run TapTrao. We'd also like to use Google Analytics to understand how people use the site. Do you accept analytics cookies?"
- Button 1: "Accept Analytics" (green) — loads GA4 and stores consent in a cookie: taptrao_cookie_consent=accepted
- Button 2: "Essential Only" (grey) — stores taptrao_cookie_consent=rejected, does not load GA4
- On return visits, read the stored preference and do not show the banner again
- Add a small "Cookie Settings" link in the footer so users can reset their preference

─────────────────────────────────────────
3. LEGAL PAGES
─────────────────────────────────────────

Create two new pages:
- Route: /privacy-policy
- Route: /terms-of-service

Both pages should:
- Use the same header and footer as the rest of the site
- Have a clean, readable layout, max-width 800px, centred
- Be linked from the existing footer (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links are already there)

Do not add any other third-party scripts, tracking pixels, or cookies beyond what is listed above.
