Add two risk features that require no new database tables.

━━━ PART 1: INSURANCE GAP ALERT ━━━

Add a static alert to the LC Checker results page.
Show it ONLY when the lc_check verdict is COMPLIANT or COMPLIANT_WITH_NOTES
(i.e. the LC check passed — goods are cleared to ship, so insurance now matters).

PLACEMENT: Below the verdict banner, above the field-by-field results.

INSURANCE GAP ALERT CARD:
  background rgba(66,126,255,.06), border 1px solid var(--blue-bd), border-radius 9px
  padding 14px 18px, margin-bottom 20px

  Header row: 🛡 icon + "Insurance gap — check your policy covers this trade"
    Font: 13px 600 color var(--t1)

  Body (12px var(--t2) line-height 1.65):
    "Standard cargo insurance (Institute Cargo Clauses A/B/C) covers physical
     loss and damage. It does NOT cover goods rejected at port due to regulatory
     non-compliance — which is a separate and common risk for agricultural and
     mineral commodities on African corridors."

  Two-column detail block (DM Mono 11px, background var(--s3), border-radius 6px, padding 10px 14px):
    Left column label "NOT covered by standard policy:"
      • Regulatory rejection at border
      • Phytosanitary detention and destruction
      • EUDR non-compliance refusal
      • Aflatoxin / contamination seizure
    Right column label "Ask your insurer about:"
      • Trade disruption insurance
      • Rejection / condemnation clause
      • Commodity-specific contamination cover
      • Political risk (for certain corridors)

  Footer (11px var(--t3)):
    "This applies regardless of Incoterms. Even under CIF or CIP, the seller's
     insurance does not cover destination regulatory rejection."

  Dismiss button (top right, small × in var(--t3)):
    localStorage key: 'insurance_alert_dismissed'
    If dismissed, don't show again in this session.

━━━ PART 2: DEMURRAGE CALCULATOR ━━━

Add a standalone calculator accessible from two places:
  1. New sidebar link under "Tools": "Demurrage Calculator"
  2. Link from the Risk section of any compliance lookup result

PAGE at /demurrage:
Use AppShell (no activeNav highlight needed — or add "Tools" section to sidebar).

Page title: "Demurrage Calculator" Fraunces 900 28px
Subtitle: "Estimate container holding costs when goods are delayed at port" 13px var(--t2)

TWO-COLUMN layout: inputs left (380px) | results right (flex:1)

Many ports apply escalating rates after day 7 and again after day 14.
Model this as:
  Days 1-7 after free period: base rate × 1.0
  Days 8-14: base rate × 1.5
  Days 15+: base rate × 2.0

RESULTS PANEL (updates live as inputs change, no submit needed):

Total chargeable days: [days held] - [free days] = [chargeable days] (min 0)

Daily cost: $[rate] × [container type] at [port]

Cost breakdown table:
  Days 1-7 (if applicable):   [days] × $[rate] = $[subtotal]
  Days 8-14 (if applicable):  [days] × $[rate × 1.5] = $[subtotal]
  Days 15+ (if applicable):   [days] × $[rate × 2.0] = $[subtotal]
  TOTAL DEMURRAGE:             $[total] — large, Fraunces 900, colour:
    < $1,000: var(--green) | $1,000-5,000: var(--amber) | > $5,000: var(--red)

If cargo value provided:
  "Demurrage as % of cargo value: [pct]%"
  Above 5%: red text + "Consider whether re-export or destruction may be cheaper."

DECISION NUDGE (always shown at bottom of results):
  "Next step: compare demurrage against alternatives"
  Three comparison cards (small, side by side):
    "Re-export" → estimated re-export freight as % of original (show "~30-50% of cargo value")
    "Destruction" → "Typically $500-5,000 depending on volume and port"
    "Appeal / re-test" → "Re-testing fee typically $200-500 + additional storage"
  Footer note (DM Mono 10px var(--t3)):
    "Rates are indicative based on published port tariffs. Actual rates vary by
     carrier, season, and contract terms. Always verify with your freight agent."

DISCLAIMER (bottom, 11px var(--t3)):
  "TapTrao demurrage estimates are based on published port tariff data and are
   provided for planning purposes only. They do not constitute financial advice."
